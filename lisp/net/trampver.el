;;; Commentary:

;; Convenience functions around the Tramp version.  Partly generated
;; during Tramp configuration.

;;; Code:

;; In the Tramp GIT repository, the version number, the bug report
;; address and the required Emacs version are auto-frobbed from
;; configure.ac, so you should edit that file and run "autoconf &&
;; ./configure" to change them.
