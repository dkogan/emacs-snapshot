(defmacro with-temp-buffer-window (buffer-or-name action quit-function &rest body)
  "Bind `standard-output' to BUFFER-OR-NAME, eval BODY, show the buffer.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must specify either a live buffer, or the name of
a buffer (if it does not exist, this macro creates it).

Make the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME empty before running
BODY and bind `standard-output' to that buffer, so that output
generated with `prin1' and similar functions in BODY goes into
that buffer.  Do not make that buffer current for running the
forms in BODY.  Use `with-current-buffer-window' instead if you
need to run BODY with that buffer current.

At the end of BODY, mark the specified buffer unmodified and
read-only, and display it in a window (but do not select it).
The display happens by calling `display-buffer' passing it the
ACTION argument.  If `temp-buffer-resize-mode' is enabled, the
corresponding window may be resized automatically.

Return the value returned by BODY, unless QUIT-FUNCTION specifies
a function.  In that case, run that function with two arguments -
the window showing the specified buffer and the value returned by
BODY - and return the value returned by that function.

If the buffer is displayed on a new frame, the window manager may
decide to select that frame.  In that case, it's usually a good
strategy if QUIT-FUNCTION selects the window showing the buffer
before reading any value from the minibuffer; for example, when
asking a `yes-or-no-p' question.

This runs the hook `temp-buffer-window-setup-hook' before BODY,
with the specified buffer temporarily current.  It runs the hook
`temp-buffer-window-show-hook' after displaying the buffer, with
that buffer temporarily current, and the window that was used to
display it temporarily selected.

This construct is similar to `with-output-to-temp-buffer' but,
neither runs `temp-buffer-setup-hook' which usually puts the
buffer in Help mode, nor `temp-buffer-show-function' (the ACTION
argument replaces this)."

This function displays BUFFER in a new window that will be

the existing window is already part of an atomic window, add the
new window to that atomic window.  Operations like `split-window'
or `delete-window', when applied to a constituent of an atomic
window, are applied atomically to the root of that atomic window.

ALIST is an association list of action symbols and values.  See
Info node `(elisp) Buffer Display Action Alists' for details of
such alists.  The following two symbols have a special meaning:

`window' specifies the existing window the new window shall be
  combined with.  Use `window-atom-root' to make the new window a
  sibling of an atomic window's root.  If an internal window is
  specified here, all children of that window become part of the
  atomic window too.  If no window is specified, the new window
  becomes a sibling of the selected window.  By default, the
  `window-atom' parameter of the existing window is set to `main'
  provided the window is live and the parameter is not set yet.

`side' denotes the side of the existing window where the new
  window shall be located.  Valid values are `below', `right',
  `above' and `left'.  The default is `below'.  By default, the
  `window-atom' parameter of the new window is set to this value.

The return value is the new window, nil when creating that window
failed.

This is an action function for buffer display, see Info
node `(elisp) Buffer Display Action Functions'.  It should be
called only by `display-buffer' or a function directly or

ALIST is an association list of action symbols and values.  See

a special meaning:

 `side' denotes the side of the frame where the new window shall

   `left'.  The default is `bottom'.

 `slot' if non-nil, specifies the window slot where to display

   the specified side.  A negative value means use a slot
   preceding (that is, above or on the left of) the middle slot.
   A positive value means use a slot following (that is, below or
   on the right of) the middle slot.  The default is zero.

If the current frame size or the settings of `window-sides-slots'
do not permit making a new window, a suitable existing window may
be reused and have its `window-slot' parameter value accordingly
modified.

side window used to BUFFER so that it does not get reused by
other `display-buffer' action functions.  Return the window used

the minibuffer window only if the minibuffer is active.  Any

on all frames that share that minibuffer too.  The following
non-nil values of ALL-FRAMES have special meanings:

- `visible' means consider all windows on all visible frames on
  the current terminal.

- 0 (the number zero) means consider all windows on all visible
  and iconified frames on the current terminal.

- A frame means consider all windows on that frame only.

If ALL-FRAMES specifies a frame, the first window walked is the
first window on that frame (the one returned by `frame-first-window'),
not necessarily the selected window.

Anything else means consider all windows on the selected frame
and no others.

;; 'prev-buffers' consists of <buffer, window-start, window-point>

;; buffer has been removed from the window, the most recently removed
;; buffer's entry being first.  The window-start and window-point
;; components are 'window-start' and 'window-point' at the time the
;; buffer was removed from the window which implies that the entry must
;; be added when 'set-window-buffer' removes the buffer from the window.

;; 'next-buffers' is the list of buffers that have been replaced
;; recently by 'switch-to-prev-buffer'.  These buffers are the least
;; preferred candidates of 'switch-to-prev-buffer' and the preferred
;; candidates of 'switch-to-next-buffer' to switch to.  This list is
;; reset to nil by any action changing the window's buffer with the

;; 'switch-to-next-buffer' pops the last pushed buffer from it.

;; replaces the buffer of the argument window with the new buffer.  It

According to information stored in WINDOW's `quit-restore' and

frame, (2) delete WINDOW but leave its frame alone, (3) restore the
buffer previously shown in WINDOW, or (4) make WINDOW display some other
buffer.  In case (3) set any of these parameters to nil if it has been
used to restore the previously shown buffer.  See Info node `(elisp)
Quitting Windows' for more details.

If WINDOW's dedicated flag is t, try to delete WINDOW.  If it equals the
value `side', restore that value when WINDOW is not deleted.  Whether
WINDOW or its frame get deleted can be further controlled via the option
`quit-restore-window-no-switch'.

If running the abnormal hook `window-deletable-functions' returns nil,
do not delete WINDOW but show some other buffer in it.

Optional second argument BURY-OR-KILL tells how to proceed with
the buffer of WINDOW.  The following values are handled:

nil means to not handle the buffer in a particular way.  This
  means that if WINDOW is not deleted by this function, invoking
  `switch-to-prev-buffer' will usually show the buffer again.

`append' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, move its buffer to
  the end of WINDOW's previous buffers so it's less likely that a
  future invocation of `switch-to-prev-buffer' will switch to it.
  Also, move the buffer to the end of the frame's buffer list.

`bury' means that if WINDOW is not deleted, remove its buffer
  from WINDOW'S list of previous buffers.  Also, move the buffer
  to the end of the frame's buffer list.  This value provides the
  most reliable remedy to not have `switch-to-prev-buffer' switch
  to this buffer again without killing the buffer.

`kill' means to kill WINDOW's buffer.

`killing' is like `kill' but means that WINDOW's buffer will get killed
elsewhere.  This value is used by `replace-buffer-in-windows' and
`quit-windows-on'.

`burying' is like `bury' but means that WINDOW's buffer will get buried
elsewhere.  This value is used by `quit-windows-on'."

(defun split-window (&optional window size side pixelwise refer)
  "Make a new window adjacent to WINDOW.
WINDOW must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.
Return the new window which is always a live window.

Optional argument SIZE a positive number means make WINDOW SIZE
lines or columns tall.  If SIZE is negative, make the new window
-SIZE lines or columns tall.  If and only if SIZE is non-nil, its
absolute value can be less than `window-min-height' or
`window-min-width'; so this command can make a new window as
small as one line or two columns.  SIZE defaults to half of
WINDOW's size.

Optional third argument SIDE nil (or `below') specifies that the
new window shall be located below WINDOW.  SIDE `above' means the
new window shall be located above WINDOW.  In both cases SIZE
specifies the new number of lines for WINDOW (or the new window
if SIZE is negative) including space reserved for the mode and/or
header line.

SIDE t (or `right') specifies that the new window shall be
located on the right side of WINDOW.  SIDE `left' means the new
window shall be located on the left of WINDOW.  In both cases
SIZE specifies the new number of columns for WINDOW (or the new
window provided SIZE is negative) including space reserved for
fringes and the scrollbar or a divider column.

For compatibility reasons, SIDE `up' and `down' are interpreted
as `above' and `below'.  Any other non-nil value for SIDE is
currently handled like t (or `right').

As a rule, if WINDOW already forms a combination that matches the SIDE
parameter and `window-combination-limit' is nil, reuse WINDOW's parent
in the window tree as parent of the new window.  If WINDOW is in a
combination that is orthogonal to the SIDE parameter or if
`window-combination-limit' is non-nil, make a new parent window that
replaces WINDOW in the window tree and make WINDOW and the new window
its sole child windows.  This standard behavior can be overridden via
the REFER argument.

PIXELWISE, if non-nil, means to interpret SIZE pixelwise.

If the optional fifth argument REFER is non-nil, it specifies a
reference window used for setting up properties of the new window.
REFER can be either a window or a cons cell of two windows.

If REFER is a cons cell, its car has to specify a deleted, former live
window - a window that has shown a buffer before - on the same frame as
WINDOW.  That buffer must be still live.  The cdr has to specify a
deleted window that was a parent window on the same frame as WINDOW
before it was deleted.  In this case, rather then making new windows,
replace WINDOW with the cdr of REFER in the window tree and make WINDOW
and REFER's car its new child windows.  Buffer, start and point
positions of REFER's car are set to the values they had immediately
before REFER's car was deleted the last time.  Decorations and
parameters remain unaltered from their values before REFER's car and cdr
were deleted.

Alternatively REFER may specify a deleted, former live window - a window
that has shown a buffer before - on the same frame as WINDOW.  In this
case do not make a new window but rather make REFER live again and
insert it into the window tree at the position and with the sizes the
new window would have been given.  Buffer, start and point positions of
REFER are set to the values they had immediately before REFER was
deleted the last time.  Decorations and parameters remain unaltered from
their values before REFER was deleted.  Throw an error if REFER's buffer
has been deleted after REFER itself was deleted.

Otherwise REFER must specify a live window.  In this case, the new
window will inherit properties like buffer, start and point position and
some decorations from REFER.  If REFER is nil or omitted, then if WINDOW
is live, any such properties are inherited from WINDOW.  If, however,
WINDOW is an internal window, the new window will inherit these
properties from the window selected on WINDOW's frame.

If the variable `ignore-window-parameters' is non-nil or the
`split-window' parameter of WINDOW equals t, do not process any
parameters of WINDOW.  Otherwise, if the `split-window' parameter of
WINDOW specifies a function, call that function with the three first
arguments WINDOW, SIZE and SIDE and return the value returned by that
function.

Otherwise, if WINDOW is part of an atomic window, \"split\" the root of
that atomic window.  The new window does not become a member of that
atomic window.

The selected window and the selected window on WINDOW's frame are not
changed by this function."

(defun display-buffer-record-window (type window buffer)
  "Record information for window used by `display-buffer'.
WINDOW is the window used for or created by a buffer display
action function.  BUFFER is the buffer to display.  Note that
this function must be called before BUFFER is explicitly made
WINDOW's buffer (although WINDOW may show BUFFER already).

TYPE specifies the type of the calling operation and must be one
of the symbols `reuse' (meaning that WINDOW exists already and
will be used for displaying BUFFER), `window' (WINDOW was created
on an already existing frame), `frame' (WINDOW was created on a
new frame) or `tab' (WINDOW is the selected window and BUFFER was
created in a new tab).

This function installs or updates the `quit-restore' parameter of
WINDOW.  The `quit-restore' parameter is a list of four elements:
The first element is one of the symbols `window', `frame', `same'
or `other'.  The second element is either one of the symbols
`window' or `frame' or a list whose elements are the buffer
previously shown in the window, that buffer's window start and
window point, and the window's height.  The third element is the
window selected at the time the parameter was created.  The
fourth element is BUFFER.

If TYPE is `reuse', BUFFER is different from the one currently displayed
in WINDOW, and WINDOW already has a `quit-restore' parameter, install or
update a `quit-restore-prev' parameter for this window.  This allows for
quitting WINDOW in a similar fashion but also keeps the very first
`quit-restore' parameter stored for this window around.  Consequently,
WINDOW (or its frame) can be eventually deleted by `quit-restore-widow'
if that parameter's fourth element equals WINDOW's buffer."

  "The first direction tried when Emacs needs to split a window.
This variable controls in which order `split-window-sensibly' will try to
split the window.  That order specially matters when both dimensions of
the frame are long enough to be split according to
`split-width-threshold' and `split-height-threshold'.  If this is set to
`vertical' (the default), `split-window-sensibly' tries to split
vertically first and then horizontally.  If set to `horizontal' it does
the opposite.  If set to `longest', the first direction tried
depends on the frame shape: in landscape orientation it will be like
`horizontal', but in portrait it will be like `vertical'.  Basically,
the longest of the two dimension is split first.

If both `split-width-threshold' and `split-height-threshold' cannot be
satisfied, it will fallback to split vertically.

See `split-window-preferred-function' for more control of the splitting
strategy."

  "Split WINDOW in a way suitable for `display-buffer'.
The variable `split-window-preferred-direction' prescribes an order of
directions in which Emacs should try to split WINDOW.  If that order
mandates starting with a vertical split, and `split-height-threshold'
specifies an integer that is at least as large a WINDOW's height, split
WINDOW into two windows one below the other and return the lower one.
If that order mandates starting with a horizontal split, and
`split-width-threshold' specifies an integer that is at least as large
as WINDOW's width, split WINDOW into two windows side by side and return
the one on the right.

In either case, if the first attempt to split WINDOW fails, try to split
the window in the other direction in the same manner as described above.
If that attempt fails too, and WINDOW is the only window on its frame,
try splitting WINDOW into two windows, one below the other, disregarding
the value of `split-height-threshold' and return the window on the
bottom.

By default `display-buffer' routines call this function to split
the largest or least recently used window.  To change the default
customize the option `split-window-preferred-function'.

You can enforce this function to not split WINDOW horizontally,
by setting (or binding) the variable `split-width-threshold' to
nil.  If, in addition, you set `split-height-threshold' to zero,
chances increase that this function does split WINDOW vertically.

In order to not split WINDOW vertically, set (or bind) the
variable `split-height-threshold' to nil.  Additionally, you can
set `split-width-threshold' to zero to make a horizontal split
more likely to occur.

Have a look at the function `window-splittable-p' if you want to
know how `split-window-sensibly' determines whether WINDOW can be
split."

 `display-buffer-in-previous-window' -- Use a window that did
    show the buffer before.

    windows that have recently been switched to.

 `display-buffer-full-frame' -- Delete other windows and use the full frame.
 `display-buffer-below-selected' -- Use or pop up a window below
    the selected one.
 `display-buffer-at-bottom' -- Use or pop up a window at the
    bottom of the selected frame.
 `display-buffer-pop-up-frame' -- Show the buffer on a new frame.
 `display-buffer-in-child-frame' -- Show the buffer in a
    child frame.
 `display-buffer-no-window' -- Do not display the buffer and
    have `display-buffer' return nil immediately.

For instance:

   (setq display-buffer-alist \\='((\".*\" display-buffer-at-bottom)))

Buffer display can be further customized to a very high degree;
the rest of this docstring explains some of the many
possibilities, and also see Info node `(emacs)Window Choice' for
more information.

BUFFER-OR-NAME must be a buffer or a string naming a live buffer.
Return the window chosen for displaying that buffer, or nil if no
such window is found.

Optional argument ACTION, if non-nil, should specify a buffer
display action of the form (FUNCTIONS . ALIST).  FUNCTIONS is
either an \"action function\" or a possibly empty list of action
functions.  ALIST is a possibly empty \"action alist\".

An action function is a function that accepts two arguments: the
buffer to display and an action alist.  Based on those arguments,
it should try to display the buffer in a window and return that
window.  An action alist is an association list mapping symbols
to values.  Action functions use the action alist passed to them
to fine-tune their behaviors.

`display-buffer' builds a list of action functions and an action
alist by combining any action functions and alists specified by
`display-buffer-overriding-action', `display-buffer-alist', the
ACTION argument, `display-buffer-base-action', and
`display-buffer-fallback-action' (in order).  Then it calls each
function in the combined function list in turn, passing the
buffer as the first argument and the combined action alist as the
second argument, until one of the functions returns non-nil.

See above for the action functions and the action they try to
perform.

Action alist entries are:
 `inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
    window from being used for display.
 `inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any frame
    used for showing the buffer from being raised or selected.
    Note that a window manager may still raise a new frame and
    give it focus, effectively overriding the value specified
    here.
 `reusable-frames' -- The value specifies the set of frames to
    search for a window that already displays the buffer.
    Possible values are nil (the selected frame), t (any live
    frame), visible (any visible frame), 0 (any visible or
    iconified frame) or an existing live frame.
 `pop-up-frames' -- Same effect as the eponymous variable.
    Takes precedence over the variable.
 `pop-up-frame-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of
    frame parameters to give a new frame, if one is created.
 `window-height' -- The value specifies the desired height of the
    window chosen and is either an integer (the total height of
    the window specified in frame lines), a floating point
    number (the fraction of its total height with respect to the
    total height of the frame's root window), a cons cell whose
    car is `body-lines' and whose cdr is an integer that
    specifies the height of the window's body in frame lines, or
    a function to be called with one argument - the chosen
    window.  That function is supposed to adjust the height of
    the window.  Suitable functions are `fit-window-to-buffer'
    and `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer'.
 `window-width' -- The value specifies the desired width of the
    window chosen and is either an integer (the total width of
    the window specified in frame lines), a floating point
    number (the fraction of its total width with respect to the
    width of the frame's root window), a cons cell whose car is
    `body-columns' and whose cdr is an integer that specifies the
    width of the window's body in frame columns, or a function to
    be called with one argument - the chosen window.  That
    function is supposed to adjust the width of the window.
 `window-size' -- This entry is only useful for windows appearing
    alone on their frame and specifies the desired size of that
    window either as a cons of integers (the total width and
    height of the window on that frame), a cons cell whose car is
    `body-chars' and whose cdr is a cons of integers (the desired
    width and height of the window's body in columns and lines of
    its frame), or a function to be called with one argument -
    the chosen window.  That function is supposed to adjust the
    size of the frame.
 `preserve-size' -- The value should be either (t . nil) to
    preserve the width of the chosen window, (nil . t) to
    preserve its height or (t . t) to preserve its height and
    width in future changes of the window configuration.
 `window-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of window
    parameters to give the chosen window.
 `allow-no-window' -- A non-nil value means that `display-buffer'
    may not display the buffer and return nil immediately.
 `some-window' -- This entry defines which window
    `display-buffer-use-some-window' should choose.  The possible choices
    are `lru' or nil (the default) to select the least recently used window,
    and `mru' to select the most recently used window.  It can also be a
    function that takes two arguments: a buffer and an alist, and should
    return the window in which to display the buffer.  If the value is
    `lru', it avoids selecting windows that are not full-width and windows
    on another frame.  If the value is `mru', it does not consider the
    selected window and windows on any frame but the selected one.  It's
    useful to customize `display-buffer-base-action' to
    `(nil . ((some-window . mru)))' when you want to display buffers in the
    same non-selected window in a configuration with more than two windows.
 `body-function' -- A function called with one argument - the
    displayed window.  It is called after the buffer is
    displayed, and before `window-height', `window-width'
    and `preserve-size' are applied.  The function is supposed
    to fill the window body with some contents that might depend
    on dimensions of the displayed window.
 `post-command-select-window' -- A non-nil value means that after the
    current command is executed and the hook `post-command-hook' is called,
    the window displayed by this function will be selected.  A nil value
    means that if functions like `pop-to-buffer' selected another window,
    at the end of this command that window will be deselected, and the
    window that was selected before calling this function will remain
    selected regardless of which windows were selected afterwards within
    this command.
 `category' -- If the caller of `display-buffer' passes an alist entry
   `(category . symbol)' in its action argument, then you can match
   the displayed buffer by using the same category in the condition
   part of `display-buffer-alist' entries.

The entries `window-height', `window-width', `window-size' and
`preserve-size' are applied only when the window used for
displaying the buffer never showed another buffer before.

The ACTION argument can also have a non-nil and non-list value.
This means to display the buffer in a window other than the
selected one, even if it is already displayed in the selected
window.  If called interactively with a prefix argument, ACTION
is t.  Non-interactive calls should always supply a list or nil.

The optional third argument FRAME, if non-nil, acts like a
\(reusable-frames . FRAME) entry appended to the action alist
specified by the ACTION argument."

ALIST is an association list of action symbols and values.  See

such alists.

ALIST has to contain a `direction' entry whose value should be
one of `left', `above' (or `up'), `right' and `below' (or `down').
Other values are usually interpreted as `below'.

If ALIST also contains a `window' entry, its value specifies a
reference window.  That value can be a special symbol like
`main' (which stands for the selected frame's main window) or
`root' (standings for the selected frame's root window) or an
arbitrary valid window.  Any other value (or omitting the
`window' entry) means to use the selected window as reference
window.

This function tries to reuse or split a window such that the
window produced this way is on the side of the reference window
specified by the `direction' entry.

Four special values for `direction' entries allow implicitly
specifying the selected frame's main window as reference window:
`leftmost', `top', `rightmost' and `bottom'.  Hence, instead of
`(direction . left) (window . main)' one can simply write
`(direction . leftmost)'.

window is not usable.  A dedicated window is usable only if it
already shows BUFFER.  If ALIST contains a `previous-window'
entry, the window specified by that entry (either a variable
or a value) is usable even if it never showed BUFFER before.

If ALIST contains a `reusable-frames' entry, its value determines
which frames to search for a usable window:
  nil -- the selected frame (actually the last non-minibuffer frame)
  A frame   -- just that frame
  `visible' -- all visible frames
  0   -- all frames on the current terminal
  t   -- all frames.

If ALIST contains no `reusable-frames' entry, search just the
selected frame if `display-buffer-reuse-frames' and
`pop-up-frames' are both nil; search all frames on the current
terminal if either of those variables is non-nil.

If more than one window is usable according to these rules,
apply the following order of preference:

- Use the window specified by any `previous-window' ALIST entry,
  provided it is not the selected window.

- Use a window that showed BUFFER before, provided it is not the
  selected window.

- Use the selected window if it is either specified by a
  `previous-window' ALIST entry or showed BUFFER before.

node `(elisp) Buffer Display Action Functions'.  It should be

  "Display BUFFER trying to avoid windows used recently.
This is similar to `display-buffer-use-some-window' but tries
hard to avoid using a window recently used by `display-buffer'.

Distinctive features are:

- Do not use the selected window.

- Try first to reuse a window that shows BUFFER already on a
  frame specified by a `reusable-frames' ALIST entry, using the
  selected frame if no such entry has been specified.

- Next try to show BUFFER in the least recently used window.  The
  frames to search for such a window can be specified via a
  `lru-frames' ALIST entry; if no such entry exists, search the
  selected frame only.  In addition, try to satisfy constraints
  specified by the following ALIST entries, if present:

  `lru-time' specifies a use time.  Do not return a window whose
    use time is higher than this.  When calling this action
    function repeatedly (presumably to display several buffers in
    a row), an application should first save the use time of the
    selected window and pass that same value via such an entry in
    each call of `display-buffer'.  This reduces the probability
    that `display-buffer' uses the same window as a previous
    call.

  `window-min-width' specifies a preferred minimum width in
    canonical frame columns.  If it is the symbol `full-width',
    prefer a full-width window.

  `window-min-height' specifies a preferred minimum height in
    canonical frame lines.  If it is the symbol `full-height',
    prefer a full-height window.

- If the preceding steps fail, try to pop up a new window on the
  selected frame.

If a window is found, bump the use time of that window to the
highest use time after the selected window.  This makes it less
probable that a future invocation of this function uses that
window for another buffer."
